# Simple-Classifier
## Project Goal
To gain a fundamental understanding of the inner workings of a deep neural network. This understanding will help make sense of more complex models with different types of layers and allow for more intuitive parameter adjustments.

## Strategy
The model creates a network using the numpy python module and creates a two-input, single-neuron neural network. See the PDF document in the repo for further details and explanation
